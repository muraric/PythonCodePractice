Absolutely, below is the Python code for a function called
decode(message_file) that decodes the input file as per the given algorithm
File name is the input for the function , and returns decoded string.

Reads the input file line by line and splits it with BLANK space as delimiter.
The number is added as the key and the word is added as the value to the dictionary code_dictionary.
The keys of the dictionary is added to the list and sorted.

The while loop is iterated till length of the key list by finding end of the line in the pyramid
by incrementing the count by 1.

def decode(message_file):
    with open(message_file) as file:
        code_dictionary = {}
        for line in file:
            code_dictionary[int(line.split()[0])] = line.split()[1]
        key_list = list(code_dictionary.keys())
        key_list.sort()
        i = 0
        j = 2
        decode_string = ""
        while i < len(key_list):
            decode_string = decode_string + code_dictionary.get(key_list[i]) + " "
            i = i + j
            j = j + 1
        return decode_string

The function stores the
